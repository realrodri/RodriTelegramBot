# RodriTelegramBot
My Telegram Bot for companies to find out more about me. Check it out!

# Requirements
I made this bot using JavaScript running it on a NodeJS server. There's a "nodemon" package where you should install to get this bot running even when you edit the files.

You'll need to install the following dependencies so far:

  - dotenv
  - express
  - telegraf
  - nodemon

You'll need to install the first 3 using "npm i [nameofthepackage]", and the last one should be installed like a dev package: npm i nodemon -D.

# Usage
You can either do "node bot.js" to have the bot running, or with a better way: "npm run dev", which will load the "nodemon" package and keep the bot running and always restarting when needed (when you make changes, obviously).

# License
You may use this code to make your own Telegram bot or any usage you may want with the exceptions of the following:

  - You may not impersonate me (Rodrigo Sánchez Gómez) with the same and exact content that follows into the bot.
  - You may not use the code I provided in this repository for bad things. That includes: piracy, hacking, phishing, stealing people's information or any matter that involves illegal actions that may be included in your country's law.
  - If you use this repository and the files included in it or fork it to modify the files and using those to make a bot, you won't need to attribute me for anything. If you do so, you're automatically commited to let people use your code and fork it the same way you did it with mine. Sharing information and knowledge that came to me freely (YouTube tutorials and free online courses available on the internet) is a must be, and so this license applies only for this repository (future repositories may include this license policy and could result in modifications).

That's it. If you follow this simple rules, you won't have any problem with the authorities. Nah, just kidding. Just, follow those rules and use it for good purposes.

Thank you to all who visits this repository and keep researching!
